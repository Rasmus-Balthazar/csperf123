aight, so the questions in question is that we are working with the algorithms:
3.1 Independant output


3.4 Count-then-move


## Roadmap
- [ ] Setup data to be used for partitioning
- [ ] Make data accessible for usage
- [ ] Setup threading for algorithms
- [ ] Implement Independant ouput
- [ ] Implement count-then-move
